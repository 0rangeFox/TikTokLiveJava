# TikTokLive Java
A Java library based on [TikTokLive](https://github.com/isaackogan/TikTokLive) and [TikTokLiveSharp](https://github.com/sebheron/TikTokLiveSharp). Use it to receive live stream events such as comments and gifts in realtime from [TikTok LIVE](https://www.tiktok.com/live) by connecting to TikTok's internal WebCast push service. The package includes a wrapper that connects to the WebCast service using just the username (`uniqueId`). This allows you to connect to your own live chat as well as the live chat of other streamers. No credentials are required. Besides [Chat Comments](#chat), other events such as [Members Joining](#member), [Gifts](#gift), [Subscriptions](#subscribe), [Viewers](#roomuser), [Follows](#social), [Shares](#social), [Questions](#questionnew), [Likes](#like) and [Battles](#linkmicbattle) can be tracked. You can also send [automatic messages](#send-chat-messages) into the chat by providing your Session ID.
